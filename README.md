ESP32 Test Repository
This repository contains code and resources for testing and experimenting with the ESP32 microcontroller using the Arduino IDE and the ESP-IDF framework. Whether you are a beginner looking to get started with ESP32 development or an experienced developer looking for sample projects and code snippets, this repository has something for you.

Getting Started
Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your ESP32 development board.

Prerequisites
Arduino IDE: You'll need the Arduino IDE installed on your computer. You can download it from the official website.

ESP32 Board Support: Make sure you have added ESP32 board support to your Arduino IDE. You can do this by following the official guide from Espressif.

ESP-IDF (Optional): If you want to work with the ESP-IDF framework, you can install it by following the instructions in the ESP-IDF documentation.
